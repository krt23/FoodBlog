      to exchange recipes and to support each other in the kitchen. We wanted to create

      aboutTheShop: { text: `In 2013 we launched our shop to bring like-minded makers and 
      artisans together with all of us. Today we curate the great things that allow you to cook 
      and eat thoughtfully, and we’ve grown to include the home goods and crafts that support joyful 
      living—and we’ve even started making some of these products with you! Great food isn't just about 
      ingredients, it's about everything that makes a meal—it's the platter you serve tacos on; 
      the composter in your kitchen; the knife you take on picnics. And joyful living goes beyond just 
      the kitchen; it’s the beeswax candles on your table, the wreath on your doorway, the linen throw 
      that accents your couch.` }

        authorAmanda: `Amanda grew up with a mom who cooked local, seasonal food. 
      She and her brother and sisters went crabbing, picked blueberries in the woods and 
      wild asparagus by the roadside (it grows by the corn fields in Maryland). Amanda lives 
      in Brooklyn (not the cool part) with her husband and 11-year-old twins.`,
        authorMerrill: `Merrill was raised not on Gerber but on vitello tonnato and 
      coeur à la creme, made by her mother, who was an excellent cook. Merrill lives with her husband 
      and two small children in Brooklyn, where she makes it to the farmers market most weekends—except 
      in the dead of winter.`},

        activityAmanda: `Amanda cooked in Europe and got her first "real job" as a Feature 
      Writer and Food Editor at The New York Times. She wrote Cooking for Mr. Latte: A Food Lover's 
      Courtship, with Recipes and The Cook and the Gardener, and edited the essay collection, Eat, Memory. 
      Her last book, The Essential New York Times Cookbook, was a Times bestseller and the winner of 
      a James Beard Award.`,
        activityMerrill: `Merrill was a freelance food editor and writer, with pieces in T Magazine, 
      Body + Soul and Edible Brooklyn, among other publications. She learned how to wield a knife 
      at Le Cordon Bleu in London and then put her chopping skills to use in the test kitchen 
      at Cook's Illustrated and behind the counter at Flour Bakery in Boston, at the same time running 
      her own catering business.`}
